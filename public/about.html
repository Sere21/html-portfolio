<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I'm an Italian newbie web dev CS student, I'm so happy to share my projects with you all.</p><br/>
<p>I also learned/am learning other languages such as:</p>
<p>C, SQL, ASM, OCaml, Java, Javascript and CSS (and of course HTML!).</p><br/>
<p>To tell you a bit more about myself, I'm a fairly nerdy person who loves videogames and cosplay. I have a very creative side and that's why I wanted to try front-end development.</p>
<p>I'm also learning 3D modeling with Blender, so stay tuned for even more interesting projects!</p>
